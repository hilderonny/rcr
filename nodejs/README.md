# NodeJS version

The combination Arduino - Python - OpenCV - Websockts does not feel good.
So here I will try to use only one language and as less software installation as possible.

The main idea is to:
* Use NodeJS on the PC as server for handling connections and motor controlling
* Use WebRTC in a browser to establish video and audio transfers between clients and the robot

Let's see, what the differences to the python approach are.
